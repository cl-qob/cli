# 🔍 About Qob

## ❓ Who should use this tool?

Here are our suggestions; if you plan to work on an OS-specific package (never
going to other platforms), go for other tools. On the other hand, Qob aims to
provide the best consistency between each OS. Alternatively, if you want to
learn a tool that works everywhere, Qob is one of the best choices.

## ❓ Where can I download the Qob snapshot?

You can download the latest executable (snapshot) in our
[cl-qob/binaries](https://github.com/cl-qob/binaries)
repository!

# 🔍 Technology Choice

## ❓ Why clingon?

There are limited options for command line parsers in Common Lisp,
so I opted for the most mature one, which is also recommended by the community.
