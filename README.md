[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/cl-qob/cli.svg?label=release&logo=github)](https://github.com/cl-qob/cli/releases/latest)

Qob attempts to be good at these things:

- Play nicely with [ASDF][] and [Quicklisp][].
- Support project local like [Qlot][] and support global scope facilities.
- Works on all modern operating systems: [Linux][], [macOS][], and [Windows][].
- No extra file required, qlfile, `.ros` files, etc.

We aim to make Qob an all-in-one tool so users no longer need to install tools like [Roswell] and [Qlot][], which only serve specific goals.

## 🚧 State of the project

We are currently in a *early-development* phase.  API, and commands are not stable.

Things might still break at any point.
